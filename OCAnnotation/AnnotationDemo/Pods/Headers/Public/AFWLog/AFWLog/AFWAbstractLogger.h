/**
 * The AFWLogger protocol specifies that an optional formatter can be added to a logger.
 * Most (but not all) loggers will want to support formatters.
 *
 * However, writting getters and setters in a thread safe manner,
 * while still maintaining maximum speed for the logging process, is a difficult task.
 *
 * To do it right, the implementation of the getter/setter has strict requiremenets:
 * - Must NOT require the logMessage method to acquire a lock.
 * - Must NOT require the logMessage method to access an atomic property (also a lock of sorts).
 *
 * To simplify things, an abstract logger is provided that implements the getter and setter.
 *
 * Logger implementations may simply extend this class,
 * and they can ACCESS THE FORMATTER VARIABLE DIRECTLY from within their logMessage method!
