// The LogFileManager protocol is designed to allow you to control all aspects of your log files.
//
// The primary purpose of this is to allow you to do something with the log files after they have been rolled.
// Perhaps you want to compress them to save disk space.
// Perhaps you want to upload them to an FTP server.
// Perhaps you want to run some analytics on the file.
//
// A default LogFileManager is, of course, provided.
// The default LogFileManager simply deletes old log files according to the maximumNumberOfLogFiles property.
//
// This protocol provides various methods to fetch the list of log files.
//
// There are two variants: sorted and unsorted.
// If sorting is not necessary, the unsorted variant is obviously faster.
// The sorted variant will return an array sorted by when the log files were created,
// with the most recently created log file at index 0, and the oldest log file at the end of the array.
//
// You can fetch only the log file paths (full path including name), log file names (name only),
// or an array of AFWLogFileInfo objects.
// The AFWLogFileInfo class is documented below, and provides a handy wrapper that
// gives you easy access to various file attributes such as the creation date or the file size.

 * Once the active log file is rolled/archived, then the oldest of the existing 3 rolled/archived log files is deleted.
 *
 * You may optionally disable this option by setting it to zero.

 * Default log file manager.

 *
 * Log files are named "<bundle identifier> <date> <time>.log"
 * Example: com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03 17-14.log

/*
 * Methods to override.
 *
 * Log files are named "<bundle identifier> <date> <time>.log"
 * Example: com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03 17-14.log
 *
 * If you wish to change default filename, you can override following two methods.
 * - newLogFileName method would be called on new logfile creation.
 * - isLogFile: method would be called to filter logfiles from all other files in logsDirectory.
 *   You have to parse given filename and return YES if it is logFile.
 *
 * **NOTE**
 * newLogFileName returns filename. If appropriate file already exists, number would be added
 * to filename before extension. You have to handle this case in isLogFile: method.
 *
 * Example:
 * - newLogFileName returns "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03.log",
 *   file "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03.log" would be created.
 * - after some time "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03.log" is archived
 * - newLogFileName again returns "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03.log",
 *   file "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03 2.log" would be created.
 * - after some time "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03 1.log" is archived
 * - newLogFileName again returns "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03.log",
 *   file "com.organization.myapp 2013-12-03 3.log" would be created.
