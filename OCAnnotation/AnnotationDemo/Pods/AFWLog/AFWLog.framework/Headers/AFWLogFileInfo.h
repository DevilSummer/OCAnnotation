/**
 * AFWLogFileInfo is a simple class that provides access to various file attributes.
 * It provides good performance as it only fetches the information if requested,
 * and it caches the information to prevent duplicate fetches.
 *
 * It was designed to provide quick snapshots of the current state of log files,
 * and to help sort log files in an array.
 *
 * This class does not monitor the files, or update it's cached attribute values if the file changes on disk.
 * This is not what the class was designed for.
 *
 * If you absolutely must get updated values,
 * you can invoke the reset method which will clear the cache.

// So here's the situation.
// Extended attributes are perfect for what we're trying to do here (marking files as archived).
// This is exactly what extended attributes were designed for.
//
// But Apple screws us over on the simulator.
// Everytime you build-and-go, they copy the application into a new folder on the hard drive,
// and as part of the process they strip extended attributes from our log files.
// Normally, a copy of a file preserves extended attributes.
// So obviously Apple has gone to great lengths to piss us off.
//
// Thus we use a slightly different tactic for marking log files as archived in the simulator.
// That way it "just works" and there's no confusion when testing.
//
// The difference in method names is indicative of the difference in functionality.
// On the simulator we add an attribute by appending a filename extension.
//
// For example:
// "mylog.txt" -> "mylog.archived.txt"
// "mylog"     -> "mylog.archived"
